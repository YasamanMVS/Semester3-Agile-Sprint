# Centralized Rental Management System (CRMS)

## Project Overview:
This project, developed by Group NO #2, aims to replace ABC Rental Management Inc.'s outdated and disparate information systems with a unified, agile, and scalable web platform. This system integrates all aspects of rental management operations into one platform, enhancing operational efficiency, tenant satisfaction, and data integrity. The CRMS promises to significantly reduce operational overhead and decrease data-related errors, while also increasing tenant retention rates.

## Description:
The CRMS is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing rental properties, tenants, and maintenance requests across Canada. It features advanced analytics for property management, a tenant portal for lease and maintenance management, and a streamlined interface for administrative and maintenance staff. This solution is not only an operational upgrade but also a strategic enhancement to support the companyâ€™s rapid expansion and improve overall service quality.

## Installation:
Details on how to install and set up the CRMS will be provided here, including any prerequisites, libraries, or frameworks needed.
### Example installation steps
```bash
$ install dependencies  
$ set up environment variables  
$ run database migrations  
$ start the server  
```
